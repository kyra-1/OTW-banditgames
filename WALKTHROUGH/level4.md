# 4. The Hidden FILE

1. locate the files in the home directory
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
   Looks like, theres no file, but a Directory instead
   > Blue coloured items are directory items
2. To inspect the directory, change the current directory
   ```bash
   cd [directory name]
   ```
3. To view the contents of the Directory, including the hidden files, if any,
    ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
4. Print the contents of the file found 
   ```bash
   cat '[file name]'
   ```
   where '' helps pass the filename as singular output

5. Voila!, you have the key to next level, Keep hacking, you lil hacker!
