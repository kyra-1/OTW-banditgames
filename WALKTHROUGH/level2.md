# 2. Dashed Filename

1. locate the files in the home directory
   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```
2. To view the contents of the unique file name,
   ```bash
   cat ./-
   ```
   where '.' represents current directory, './[filename]' is the path to the file

   >Dashed filenames are used as a trick — to hide files, test your skills, break assumptions, or mess with automation tools. Think of them as Linux’s version of a plot twist 😏
