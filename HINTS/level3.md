# 🕵️ Level 3 Hint — Hide & Seek

Time to sharpen those eyes 🧠✨

There’s a file with the next password... but it might not have a *straightforward* name.

📂 Start with what you know:
```bash
ls
```
But files can be named in tricky ways — spaces, dots, dashes, or even weird symbols 🙃

```bash
ls -a
```
...or even:
```bash
ls -l
```
🔎 Pro Tip: If the file name is weird or full of symbols, you might need to **quote it** or **use tab completion**.

>Don't assume files always want to be found — some like to stay hidden 😌
