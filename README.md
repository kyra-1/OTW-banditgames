# 🕶️ OTW-BanditGames Walkthrough & Hints

Heya! I'm Yashika/ kyra-1 ! 👋  
This repo is a personal yet publicly useful guide to **OverTheWire: Bandit**, a beginner-friendly wargame that teaches Linux fundamentals and cybersecurity basics through SSH-based challenges. I created this to both document my own learning and to help *you* get unstuck when needed 🖤
